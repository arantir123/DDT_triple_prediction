# FLONE: fully Lorentz network embedding for inferring novel drug targets

How to use it:

1. Unfold the file ./DDT_triple_prediction/DDT/data/Cross_validation_split.rar, to obtain the required model input for each fold.
2. Use the instruction of each .py file to execute different variants described in the manuscript on each fold:
  Eucli_ECFP6_seqsimilarity.py: for Euclidean based variants using domain knowledge
  Eucli_noECFP6_noseqsimilarity.py: for Euclidean based variants without using domain knowledge
  Eucli_visualization: visualize the spatial layout of target embeddings under given drug and disease based on Euclidean KGC methods
